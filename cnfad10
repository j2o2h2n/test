Create a Dockerfile

FROM openjdk:17-alpine

WORKDIR /opt

COPY target/*.jar /opt/app.jar

ENTRYPOINT exec java $JAVA_OPTS -jar app.jar


After creating the dockerfile, run the project as maven install and then create the yml file

Create  a kuber.yml (this is deployment purpose)

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
